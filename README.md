Venus Services is a service that enables you to upload document to DocumentStore, semantic document search use case and training
model (**coming soon**).
Whether you want to perform Question Answering or semantic document search, you can use the SOTA NLP models
in Venus hub to provide unique search experiences and allow your users to query in natural language.

## Core Features

- **Latest models**: Utilize all latest transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, PhoBert) for extractive QA,
  generative QA, and document retrieval.
- **Open**: 100% compatible with HuggingFace's model hub and Venus hub *(internal use only)*. Tight interfaces to other
  frameworks (e.g., Transformers, FARM, sentence-transformers)
- **Scalable**: Scale to millions of docs via retrievers, production-ready backends like Elasticsearch / FAISS (coming
  soon), and a fastAPI REST API
- **End-to-End**: All tooling in one place: training, eval, inference, etc.
